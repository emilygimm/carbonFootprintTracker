# Problem Statement

In today's world, everyone is aware of the climate crisis and the need to start implementing environmentally friendly practices into their everyday routines. However, many struggle to set, track, and keep up with those habits due to a lack of guidance or motivation.



The EPA's website has a great carbon footprint calculator, with information about different environmental topics, laws and regulations, and a way to report environmental violations.

This carbon footprint tracker application focuses on creating sustainable goals, tracking progress through a short survey with questions on home energy usage, transportation, and waste information, and helping users stay committed to their environmental goals to make a meaningful impact on the planet. Unlike other emissions calculators with several pages of overwhelming information, I'd like to build a simplified carbon footprint tracker website to make information easier to navigate while tracking personal environmental goals.
