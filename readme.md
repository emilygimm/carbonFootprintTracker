# Emily Gimm Individual Project
# Problem Statement

In today's world, individuals are aware of the climate crisis and the need to start implementing environmentally friendly practices into their everyday routines. However, many people struggle to set, track, and keep up with those habits due to lack of guidance or motivation.

This carbon footprint tracker application focuses on creating sustainable goals, tracking progress with a short survey that includes home energy usage, transportation, and waste information, and helping users to stay committed to their environmental goals to make a meaningful impact on the planet. Unlike other emissions calculators, I'd like to build an easy-to-use, simplified carbon footprint tracker website to make information easier to understand and more accessible.
