### Week 3
2/9/2025 - 3 hours

Tasks completed:
* Wrote problem statement
* Started project plan
* Created design screens
* Created user stories
* Created time log/weekly reflection

 This week I decided on my project idea and started creating the problem statement, user stories, project plan and design screens, I probably had too much fun creating a mood board when making the wireframe.
